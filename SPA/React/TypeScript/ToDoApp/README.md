Why yarn?

Yarn is a new package manager for node. js. 
It is a common project developed by such companies as Facebook, Exponent, Google, and Tilde. 
It is distributed under the BSD license.Yarn is a package manager for your code. 
It allows you to use and share (e.g. JavaScript) code with other developers from around the world. 
Yarn does this quickly, securely, and reliably so you don't ever have to worry.
Comparing the speed, yarn is the clear winner. 
Both Yarn and NPM download packages from the npm repository, using yarn add vs npm install command. 
However, Yarn is much faster than NPM as it installs all the packages simultaneously. 
It also cashes every download avoiding the need to re-install packages.

Yet Another Resource Negotiator  - Yarn 

Yarn is available in the NPM package, so to install Yarn NPM has to be installed first.
Yarn is much more reliable and stable than NPM.
